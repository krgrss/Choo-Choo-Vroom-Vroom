## Data-driven Insights and Predictions to Improve TTC Transit Reliability

# Description:

This project is a comprehensive transit delay analysis that takes in raw datasets from multiple transportation modesâ€”including bus, streetcar, and subway into visual disgrams 
and readable data. It integrates external weather data, GTFS route information, and time-based features such as rolling averages and lag metrics to predict transit delays. 
It also employs machine learning techniques, using XGBoost for both classification (predicting the occurrence of delays) and regression (estimating the delay duration), while also 
offering visualizations and interpretability tools like SHAP to analyze model performance and feature importance.
